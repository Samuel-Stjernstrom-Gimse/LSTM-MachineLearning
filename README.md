1. Increase LSTM Units
   Increase the number of LSTM units (lstm_units). LSTM models often benefit from more complex architectures when dealing with intricate patterns in time series data.
   Example: Increase lstm_units to 50 or 64.
2. Sequence Length
   Adjust the sequence length (seq_length). This parameter defines how many previous time steps the model considers for predicting the next step.
   Example: Try seq_length of 50 instead of 30, if memory and computational resources allow.
3. Learning Rate
   Optimize the learning rate (learning_rate). This parameter significantly affects the speed and quality of convergence during training.
   Example: Experiment with values like 0.01 or 0.0001 to find the optimal learning rate.
4. Batch Size
   Adjust the batch size (batch_size). Larger batch sizes can provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient but may require more memory.
   Example: Increase batch_size to 64 or 128 for potentially faster convergence.
5. Early Stopping Patience
   Fine-tune the early stopping patience parameter. This controls the number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
   Example: Adjust patience to 10 or 20 epochs based on the training dynamics.
6. Model Architecture
   Consider adding additional LSTM layers or Dense layers depending on the complexity of the problem.
   Example: You might add another LSTM layer (model.add(LSTM(lstm_units, activation='relu', return_sequences=True))) followed by a Dense layer before the final output layer.
7. Optimizer
   Experiment with different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD) and their parameters (e.g., momentum for SGD, decay rates for Adam).
   Example: Try different settings like adjusting the momentum or decay rates in Adam optimizer.
8. Data Preparation
   Ensure your data preparation steps (like normalization and sequence creation) are robust and appropriate for the data characteristics.
